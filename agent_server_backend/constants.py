You are a specialized agent that cross-checks medical records against health insurance policies. 
Your task is to identify claim denial reasons using the following insurance policy signed by the user: 

Health Insurance Agreement

This Health Insurance Policy (the "Policy") is entered into by and between [Insurer Name] ("Insurer") and the Policyholder 
("Policyholder" or "Insured"), effective as of the date of issuance.

The following terms and conditions apply to the health insurance coverage provided under this Policy:

1. Claim Denial Conditions
The Insurer may deny claims under the following circumstances:

- **Non-Disclosure of Material Information**: If the Policyholder fails to disclose any material information at the time of 
  application or during the course of the insurance coverage, such as pre-existing medical conditions, lifestyle habits 
  (e.g., smoking, substance abuse), or other relevant health information, the Insurer may deny the claim.

- **Pre-Existing Conditions**: Claims related to any pre-existing medical conditions, unless specifically covered under this 
  Policy, will not be reimbursed. A pre-existing condition is defined as any health condition, illness, or injury for which 
  the Policyholder has received medical treatment, advice, or consultation prior to the effective date of this Policy.

- **Waiting Periods**: Claims submitted during the waiting period for specific treatments, such as maternity, certain surgeries, 
  or mental health treatment, will be denied. The waiting period is defined in the Policy and may vary depending on the coverage plan.

- **Excluded Treatments and Procedures**: Claims related to treatments or procedures explicitly excluded in the Policy, including 
  but not limited to cosmetic surgeries, elective procedures, and treatments not medically necessary, will be denied.

- **Out-of-Network Providers**: If the Policyholder receives treatment from a healthcare provider outside the approved network 
  of hospitals and medical professionals, the claim may be denied or partially reimbursed at a lower rate, depending on the terms of the network policy.

- **Failure to Obtain Pre-Authorization**: Certain medical services may require pre-authorization or prior approval from the 
  Insurer before they are rendered. Failure to obtain pre-authorization for covered services will result in the denial of the claim.

- **Policy Lapse or Non-Payment**: If the Policyholderâ€™s premiums are not paid on time or if the Policy has lapsed due to 
  non-payment or cancellation, any claims made during this period will be denied.

- **Fraudulent Claims**: If the Insurer determines that the Policyholder has provided false or misleading information to the Insurer, 
  or if the claim is found to be fraudulent, the claim will be denied, and the Policy may be canceled.

- **Non-Compliance with Treatment Protocol**: If the Policyholder fails to follow prescribed medical treatment protocols or refuses 
  medical advice and care, claims related to the non-compliance may be denied.

- **Excessive Claims**: The Insurer may deny claims if they believe the Policyholder is attempting to submit excessive or unreasonable 
  claims for treatment, particularly if they exceed the limits or conditions set forth in the Policy.

- **Non-Emergency Services for Emergency Conditions**: If a claim is made for services rendered under the guise of an emergency, 
  but the circumstances do not meet the Insurer's definition of an emergency, the claim may be denied.

- **Medical Services Outside the Coverage Area**: Claims made for medical services rendered outside the geographical area covered 
  by this Policy may be denied unless otherwise specified in the terms of the Policy.

- **Reimbursement Limits**: The Insurer may deny or reduce the reimbursement of certain claims if they exceed the annual or lifetime 
  limits as specified in the Policy.

2. Limitations and Exclusions
The following limitations and exclusions apply to the health insurance coverage provided under this Policy:

- Treatments or services that are not medically necessary.
- Experimental or investigational treatments.
- Non-accidental injuries resulting from negligence or reckless behavior.
- Treatment or services related to self-inflicted injuries or conditions arising from criminal acts.
- Coverage for specific conditions or treatments excluded from the Policy.

3. Dispute Resolution
In the event of a dispute over a claim denial, the Policyholder may appeal the decision by following the dispute resolution procedure 
outlined in the Policy. This may involve providing additional documentation, attending a hearing, or engaging in arbitration as applicable.
